# Ready2Rig
A small Maya plugin to check FT, history, pivot and symmetry before going into the rigging stage.

Done with _PySide_.

This is my first python project. 

##Initial motivation

During my VIZA 613 3D animation class, I had to model, rig, and do all the stages to finish an animation.

It's already difficult enough to learn how to use Maya for the first time, not to mention there's so many redundant
actions(mostly pushing the same button again and again). So I've decided to do several plugins to help with this process.

The first one is this ready2rig script. Basically it checks whether the transformation for all models are freezed, delete all the history,
check pivot points(whether it's at origin), symmetry(this greatly reduces workload in rigging stage).

Enjoy.

##Installation
Download/clone the repository and unzip it, drag or source script it to Maya script editor. Run it(green play button on menu bar), there you have it.
##Thanks
Thanks to all the awesome tutorials from zurbrigg!
